# LangX

Let's start by saying that LangX is still under heavy development.

I started developing it to help me learn new languages. It is based on the idea that acquiring vocabulary by reading texts that are of interest to us is easier, more appealing and -more importantly- more effective than reviewing stand alone flashcards, as most language learning software seem to do these days.

Other programs, like [Learning with Texts (LWT)] (http://lwt.sourceforge.net/) and [Readlang] (http://readlang.com/), are similar to LangX, but they end up skewing the reading process by converting it into a merely extractive process in which we end up focusing on choosing the words and phrases we don't know in order to create new flashcards. So, the endgame is to create new flashcards and the real learning process comes from reviewing them, not reading. Instead, reading becomes an instrument in that boring and tiresome scheme.

If you ever used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and other [spaced repetition software] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) you probably know that creating new flashcards can become a very tiresome and time consuming task and, after a while, reviewing them also becomes dull and monotonous. For me, learning new vocabulary is not just a memory exercise. Real learning consists of two phases: understanding and practice. The first one is easy to catch, you can't learn new vocabulary if you don't understand what it means or how to use it. Practice, on the other hand, is a repetitive task which includes making mistakes, correcting them and repeating this operation several times until you don't make any more mistakes. When learning a language, the only way to practice it is by putting it to use. We do that in two ways: speaking and writing.

Still, how can we improve our speaking and writing skills when we don't have a loving mom who calmly tries to teach us how to pronounce each word or a teacher who tells us how to write down new words? These are the ways in which we learn speaking and writing in our native language. However, we usually lack these friendly mentors when we grow up. People tend to be more judgmental and usually don't have enough time to teach us. As we grow up we also tend to be more perfectionist and harsh with our own performance. All this conspires against the creation of an environment conducive to learning. But, there might be a solution to this problem: active reading.

Reading alone has some nice benefits. It allows us to acquire vocabulary in context, by presenting words and phrases as they are used, including grammar, spelling, inflections, etc. Also, when we read the importance of commonly used words or phrases is more evident. Additionally, if we choose a text that is of interest to us, the context of that word or phrase we are trying to learn becomes more relevant and memorable, therefore facilitating vocabulary acquisition. Further, as this new vocabulary is relevant to the subjects that we are interested in, we are more likely to remember it in the future. Reading can also help us learn vocabulary that we know we will often want to use ourselves, therefore creating a hidden need to fully incorporate it.

Reading has one final advantage: we already do it a lot when surfing the Web. We only need to take advantage of this to learn new languages. But for that to succeed, the reading process should meet certain criteria that it usually does not. This is what I call "active reading", and it consists of the following:

  - Texts should be short (the length of a newspaper article or a short story, not a book)

  - Users should start focusing on understanding the general meaning of the text, then its parts (paragraphs, phrases and specific words)

  - Users should be allowed to easily search the meaning of new words and phrases and add them to their learning stack

  - Words and phrases that are being learned should be highlighted, as a way to let users check if they understand their meaning in each particular context

  - Texts should include audio

  - Users should read out loud, trying to imitate the audio that is being played. Training your mouth's muscles is key to achieving a good accent. A natural and stress-free way of improving your speaking skills is by repeating someone else's words without thinking what is the correct way to say this or that, or how the phrase should be constructed.

  - Users should be compelled to read the same text a couple of times so that they really understand it and are able to practice with it.

## Getting Started

Just add some text along with its audio and start reading. To search for the meaning of words you only need to click on them. They will be highlighted next time you see them. After reading three different texts that include this word, it will no longer be highlighted.

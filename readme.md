# Aprelendo

Let's start by saying that Aprelendo is still under heavy development.

I started developing it to help me learn new languages. It is based on the idea that acquiring vocabulary by reading texts that are of interest to us is easier, more appealing and -more importantly- more effective than reviewing stand alone flashcards, as most language learning software seem to do these days.

## Why are flashcards bad for language learning?

Other programs, like [Learning with Texts (LWT)](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/) and [Readlang](https://readlang.com/), are similar to Aprelendo, but they end up skewing the reading process by converting it into a merely extractive process in which we end up focusing on choosing the words and phrases we don't know in order to create new flashcards. So, the endgame is to create new flashcards and the real learning process comes from reviewing them, not reading. Instead, reading becomes an instrument in that boring and tiresome scheme.

If you ever used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and other [spaced repetition software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) you probably know that creating new flashcards can become a very tiresome and time consuming task and, after a while, reviewing them also becomes dull and monotonous. 

## Let's try an alternative: total reading

Reading alone has some nice benefits. It allows us to acquire vocabulary in context, by presenting words and phrases as they are used, including grammar, spelling, inflections, etc. Also, the importance of commonly used words or phrases is more evident while reading them.

These benefits are enhaced if we are interested in the subject of the text. In that case, the context of the words or phrases we are trying to learn becomes more relevant and memorable, therefore facilitating vocabulary acquisition. It can also help us learn vocabulary that we know we will often want to use ourselves, therefore creating a hidden need to fully incorporate it.

Reading has one final advantage: we already do it a lot as we surf the Web. We only need to take advantage of this to learn new languages. However, the biggest limitation of this strategy is that it would only cover one of the four dimensions mentioned above. To become "total", the reading process has to meet certain criteria (which usually does not):

Additionally, if we choose a text that is of interest to us, the context of that word or phrase we are trying to learn becomes more relevant and memorable, therefore facilitating vocabulary acquisition. Further, as this new vocabulary is relevant to the subjects that we are interested in, we are more likely to remember it in the future. Reading can also help us learn vocabulary that we know we will often want to use ourselves, therefore creating a hidden need to fully incorporate it.

However, the biggest limitation of this strategy is that it would only cover one of the four dimensions mentioned above. To become "total", the reading process has to meet certain criteria (which usually does not):

  - Texts should be short (the length of a newspaper article or a short story, not a book)

  - Users should be compelled to read the same text a couple of times so that they really understand it and are able to practice.

  - Users should start focusing on understanding the general meaning of the text, then its parts (paragraphs, phrases and specific words)

  - Users should be allowed to easily search the meaning of new words and phrases and add them to their learning stack

  - Words and phrases that are being learned should be highlighted, as a way to let users check if they understand their meaning in each particular context

  - Texts should include audio

  - Users should be encouraged to read the text out loud, trying to imitate the audio that is being played. Training mouth muscles is key to achieving a good accent. A natural and stress-free way of improving your speaking skills is by repeating someone else's words without thinking what is the correct way to say this or that, or how the phrase should be constructed.

## How does Aprelendo implement total reading?

Aprelendo allows reading texts in two modes: free and assisted. The former lets users to read texts without any constraints, while the latter forces users to go through the text at least 3 times: the first, to understand its general meaning and listen to the audio, the second to search for the meaning of unknown phrases and words, and the third (which consists of a dictation) to practice how to write the words marked as unknown.

By using Aprelendo you will be practicing all four dimensions of the language you want to learn at the same time, in a systematic and integrated way.
